## Production ready AI assistant framework

The Cheshire Cat is a framework to build custom AIs on top of any language model. 
If you have ever used systems like WordPress or Django to build web apps, imagine the Cat as a similar tool, but specific for AI.

The current version is a multi-tenant fork of the original [Cheshire Cat](https://github.com/cheshire-cat-ai/core).
While the original project has some security holes and is not ready for scalable production, the AI Blackbird community
is releasing a new version that will be more secure and scalable.

Moreover, this version produced by the AI Blackbird community has a lot of new features and improvements, such as:
- A new admin panel that allows you to chat with the AI, visualize the memory and plugins, and adjust the settings.
- A new plugin system that allows you to extend the AI with new features.
- A new event system that allows you to get fine-grained control over the AI.
- **The ability to manage multiple RAGs and other language models at the same time**.

Whilst the original version stored the settings into JSON files, our version requires a Redis database to store the
settings, the conversation histories, the plugins and so forth. You can configure the Redis database by environment variables.

This new version is completely compatible with the original version, so you can easily migrate your existing plugins
and settings to the new version. It is still in development, but you can already try it out by running the Docker image.
New features will be added in the future. Please contact us if you want to contribute.

## Quickstart

To make Cheshire Cat run on your machine, you just need [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 1865:80 ghcr.io/ai-blackbird/cheshirecat-core:latest
```
- Chat with the Cheshire Cat on [localhost:1865/admin](http://localhost:1865/admin).
- You can also interact via REST API and try out the endpoints on [localhost:1865/docs](http://localhost:1865/docs)

As a first thing, the Cat will ask you to configure your favourite language model.
It can be done directly via the interface in the Settings page (top right in the admin).

Enjoy the Cat!  
Follow instructions on how to run it with [docker compose and volumes](https://cheshire-cat-ai.github.io/docs/quickstart/installation-configuration/).

## Minimal plugin example

```python
from cat.mad_hatter.decorators import tool, hook

# hooks are an event system to get finegraned control over your assistant
@hook
def agent_prompt_prefix(prefix, cat):
    prefix = """You are Marvin the socks seller, a poetic vendor of socks.
You are an expert in socks, and you reply with exactly one rhyme.
"""
    return prefix

# langchain inspired tools (function calling)
@tool(return_direct=True)
def socks_prices(color, cat):
    """How much do socks cost? Input is the sock color."""
    prices = {
        "black": 5,
        "white": 10,
        "pink": 50,
    }

    price = prices.get(color, 0)
    return f"{price} bucks, meeeow!" 
```

## Conversational form example

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from cat.experimental.form import form, CatForm

# data structure to fill up
class PizzaOrder(BaseModel):
    pizza_type: str
    phone: int

# forms let you control goal oriented conversations
@form
class PizzaForm(CatForm):
    description = "Pizza Order"
    model_class = PizzaOrder
    start_examples = [
        "order a pizza!",
        "I want pizza"
    ]
    stop_examples = [
        "stop pizza order",
        "not hungry anymore",
    ]
    ask_confirm = True

    def submit(self, form_data):
        
        # do the actual order here!

        # return to convo
        return {
            "output": f"Pizza order on its way: {form_data}"
        }
```

- üöÄ Extensible via plugins (public plugin registry + private plugins allowed)
- üéö Event callbacks, function calling (tools), conversational forms
- üèõ Easy to use admin panel (chat, visualize memory and plugins, adjust settings)
- üåç Supports any language model (works with OpenAI, Google, Ollama, HuggingFace, custom services)
- üêã Production ready - 100% [dockerized](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Active [Discord community](https://discord.gg/bHX5sNFCYU) and easy to understand [docs](https://cheshire-cat-ai.github.io/docs/)

"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
"I don't much care where--" said Alice.
"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.
